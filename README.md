<h1>All-Star Solitair</h1>

A native Android Solitaire game, which was made for a Udacity project. All-Star Solitaire is still under development and will be released to the Google Play Store once completed.
    
Most of the Solitaire game logic can be reused for other solitaire apps or Java programs, but if you use any of this code, please give me (Dominique Debergue) proper credit!

<h2>Game logic files:</h2>

All the game logic resides in *src/main/java/com/metagaming/allstarsolitare/gameBoard*. The most important files to reference are *Deck.java*, *LogicHelper.java*, *ScoreKeeper.java*, *UniqueMoves.java*, and *Game.java*.
